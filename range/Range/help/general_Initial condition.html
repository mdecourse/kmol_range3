<h1>Initial condition</h1>
<p><b>Initial condition</b> is a condition specified at the boundary, where boundary can be any model entity (Point, Line, Surface, Volume) and can be seen as a starting point for the solver. For <b>Steady-state problems</b>, well chosen <b>Initial condition</b> improve solver convergence.</p>
<p>Initial conditions are <b>Problem</b> specific where each <b>Problem type</b> defines its own set of <b>initial conditions</b>.
