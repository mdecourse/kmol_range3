<h1>Boundary condition</h1>
<p><b>Boundary condition</b> is a condition specified at the boundary, where boundary can be any model entity (Point, Line, Surface, Volume).</p>
<p>Boundary conditions are:
<ul>
<li><b>Problem</b> specific - Each <b>Problem type</b> defines its own set of <b>boundary conditions</b>.</li>
<li><b>Explicit</b> - Exact solution is prescribed at the boundary (eg. <b>Temperature</b> for <b>Heat transfer</b>). Bold text in <b>Boundary conditions</b> list.</li>
<li><b>Implicit</b> - Implies a solution at the boundary (eg. <b>Heat flux</b> for <b>Heat transfer</b>).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If problem is <b>transient</b> (time-dependent) then time dependent values can be assigned to boundary condition.</p>
